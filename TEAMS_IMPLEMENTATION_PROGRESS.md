# Teams Functionality: Implementation Progress Summary

This document summarizes the development progress for implementing the Teams functionality as outlined in `TEAMS_FUNCTIONALITY.md`.

## Phase 1: Backend Setup (Supabase & Server-side SvelteKit)

### 1. Database Schema Implementation

**A. New Tables Created:**

*   **`public.teams`**
    *   `id`: `uuid` (Primary Key, default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
    *   `name`: `text` (Not Null)
    *   `owner_user_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `auth.users.id`, Not Null, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`)
    *   `created_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
    *   `updated_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
*   **`public.team_members`** (Junction table)
    *   `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, Part of Composite Primary Key)
    *   `user_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `auth.users.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, Part of Composite Primary Key)
    *   `role`: `public.team_role` (Enum, Not Null)
    *   `joined_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
*   **`public.team_invitations`**
    *   `id`: `uuid` (Primary Key, default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
    *   `team_id`: `uuid` (FK to `teams.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`)
    *   `email_invited`: `text` (Not Null)
    *   `invited_by_user_id`: `uuid` (FK to `auth.users.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`)
    *   `status`: `public.invitation_status` (Enum, Not Null, default: 'pending')
    *   `created_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
    *   `expires_at`: `timestamptz` (Nullable)

**B. New ENUM Types Created:**

*   `public.team_role`: (`'admin'`, `'editor'`, `'viewer'`)
*   `public.invitation_status`: (`'pending'`, `'accepted'`, `'declined'`)

**C. Modifications to Existing Tables:**

*   **`public.items`**:
    *   Added `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id`, Nullable, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
*   **`public.entities`**:
    *   Added `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id`, Nullable, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
*   **`public.tags`**:
    *   Added `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id`, Nullable, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
*   `public.categories` remains global and unchanged regarding team association.

**D. Helper SQL Functions Created:**

*   `public.is_team_member(p_team_id uuid, p_user_id uuid) RETURNS boolean`: Checks if a user is a member of a team.
*   `public.get_user_role_in_team(p_team_id uuid, p_user_id uuid) RETURNS public.team_role`: Gets a user's role in a team.

**E. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Defined and Applied:**

*   **`public.teams`**:
    *   `INSERT`: "Allow authenticated users to create teams" (`WITH CHECK (true)` for `authenticated`).
    *   `SELECT`: "Allow members to view their teams" (`USING (true)` for `authenticated`) - **CURRENTLY INSECURE AND TEMPORARY for debugging team creation. Needs to be reverted to `USING (public.is_team_member(id, auth.uid()))`**.
    *   `UPDATE`: "Allow team admins to update their teams" (Admins can update).
    *   `DELETE`: "Allow team admins to delete their teams" (Admins can delete).
*   **`public.team_members`**:
    *   `SELECT`: "View team members" (`USING (public.is_team_member(public.team_members.team_id, auth.uid()))` - fixed from recursive version).
    *   `INSERT`: "Admins can add team members" (Admins can add).
    *   `UPDATE`: "Admins can update roles of other team members" (Admins can update others' roles, immutability of `team_id`, `user_id` handled by trigger).
    *   `DELETE`: "Admins can remove other team members" & "Members can leave team".
*   **`public.team_invitations`**:
    *   `INSERT`: "Admins can create team invitations".
    *   `SELECT`: "Users can view their invitations and admins their team invitations".
    *   `UPDATE`: "Invited users can update status of their pending invitations" (Invitees can accept/decline, immutability of other fields handled by trigger).
    *   `DELETE`: "Admins can delete pending invitations for their team".
*   **`public.items`**, **`public.entities`**, **`public.tags`**:
    *   `SELECT`: Allows any team member (`is_team_member`).
    *   `INSERT`: Allows team 'admin' or 'editor' (`get_user_role_in_team`).
    *   `UPDATE`: Allows team 'admin' or 'editor'.
    *   `DELETE`: Allows team 'admin' or 'editor'.

**F. Triggers Created (for RLS workarounds due to `OLD.` syntax issues):**

*   On `public.team_members` (`BEFORE UPDATE`):
    *   `enforce_team_member_immutability` using `public.prevent_team_member_immutable_fields_update()`: Prevents changes to `team_id` and `user_id` on update.
*   On `public.team_invitations` (`BEFORE UPDATE`):
    *   `enforce_invitation_immutability_by_invitee` using `public.prevent_invitation_immutable_fields_update_by_invitee()`: Prevents invitees from changing immutable fields when accepting/declining.

**G. Database Privileges (Grants):**

*   The `authenticated` role has been granted `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` (and others) on `public.teams`.
*   Similar grants likely exist or were implicitly handled for other tables based on RLS setup.

### 2. Type Generation

*   Supabase type definitions (`src/lib/supabase.ts` or similar) were assumed to be updated by the user after schema changes.
*   Custom types in `src/lib/types.ts` were updated:
    *   Added `team_id: string | null;` to `LinkedEntity`, `Entity`, `Tag`, `ItemEntry`.
    *   Added new types: `TeamRole` (enum), `InvitationStatus` (enum), `Team` (interface), `TeamMember` (interface), `TeamInvitation` (interface).

### 3. Data Migration Strategy & Script

*   A SQL script was developed and executed for the single existing user (`bc2e82aa-5293-4606-940d-77d57bfd9702`):
    1.  Created a new "Personal Team".
    2.  Made the user an 'admin' of this new team in `team_members`.
    3.  Updated their existing `items`, `entities`, and `tags` by populating `team_id` to associate them with this new personal team.

### 4. Server-Side API Endpoints (SvelteKit)

*   **`src/routes/app/teams/+page.server.ts`** created:
    *   **`load` function**: Fetches and returns a list of teams the current user is a member of (along with their role in each team). This is now working after fixing `team_members` RLS recursion.
    *   **`actions.createTeam`**: 
        *   Attempts to create a new team in the `teams` table.
        *   Then attempts to add the creator as an 'admin' in the `team_members` table.
        *   **Current Status**: The insertion into `teams` now works (after temporarily making its `SELECT` RLS `USING (true)` to allow `.select()` to function post-insert). However, the subsequent insertion into `team_members` fails due to RLS (`WITH CHECK (public.get_user_role_in_team(team_id, auth.uid()) = 'admin')`), as the user is not yet an admin of the brand new team.

*   **`src/routes/app/teams/+page.svelte`** created:
    *   Displays the list of teams fetched by the `load` function.
    *   Provides a form to create a new team, calling the `createTeam` action.
    *   Handles form feedback (success/error messages).
    *   A Svelte linter error regarding `form.error = undefined` was fixed.

## Current Status & Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Team Creation Blocked:** The primary blocker is the RLS on `team_members` preventing the `createTeam` action from adding the team creator as the initial admin.
2.  **Insecure `SELECT` RLS on `teams`:** The `SELECT` RLS policy on `public.teams` is temporarily set to `USING (true)`, which is insecure. This needs to be reverted to `USING (public.is_team_member(id, auth.uid()))` once team creation is fixed.
3.  **User Preference:** The user has expressed a preference to solve the team creation transactional issue (inserting into `teams` and then `team_members`) by adjusting RLS policies rather than implementing a `SECURITY DEFINER` database function.

**Planned Next Move:**

*   Modify the `INSERT` RLS policy on the `public.team_members` table. The updated policy will allow a user to be added as an 'admin' to a team if they are the `owner_user_id` of that team (specifically for the initial setup). This will allow the existing SvelteKit `createTeam` action (with its two separate insert steps) to succeed.
*   After confirming successful team creation with the modified RLS, revert the `SELECT` RLS policy on `public.teams` to its secure version: `USING (public.is_team_member(id, auth.uid()))`.
