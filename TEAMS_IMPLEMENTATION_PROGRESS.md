# Teams Functionality: Implementation Progress Summary

This document summarizes the development progress for implementing the Teams functionality as outlined in `TEAMS_FUNCTIONALITY.md`.

## Phase 1: Backend Setup (Supabase & Server-side SvelteKit)

### 1. Database Schema Implementation

**A. New Tables Created:**

*   **`public.teams`**
    *   `id`: `uuid` (Primary Key, default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
    *   `name`: `text` (Not Null)
    *   `owner_user_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `auth.users.id`, Not Null, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`)
    *   `created_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
    *   `updated_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
*   **`public.team_members`** (Junction table)
    *   `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, Part of Composite Primary Key)
    *   `user_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `auth.users.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`, Part of Composite Primary Key)
    *   `role`: `public.team_role` (Enum, Not Null)
    *   `joined_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
*   **`public.team_invitations`**
    *   `id`: `uuid` (Primary Key, default: `uuid_generate_v4()`)
    *   `team_id`: `uuid` (FK to `teams.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`)
    *   `email_invited`: `text` (Not Null)
    *   `invited_by_user_id`: `uuid` (FK to `auth.users.id` `ON DELETE CASCADE`)
    *   `status`: `public.invitation_status` (Enum, Not Null, default: 'pending')
    *   `created_at`: `timestamptz` (default: `now()`)
    *   `accepted_at`: `timestamptz` (Nullable)

**B. New ENUM Types Created:**

*   `public.team_role`: (`'admin'`, `'editor'`, `'viewer'`)
*   `public.invitation_status`: (`'pending'`, `'accepted'`, `'declined'`)

**C. Modifications to Existing Tables:**

*   **`public.items`**:
    *   Added `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id`, Nullable, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
*   **`public.entities`**:
    *   Added `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id`, Nullable, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
*   **`public.tags`**:
    *   Added `team_id`: `uuid` (Foreign Key to `teams.id`, Nullable, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
*   `public.categories` remains global and unchanged regarding team association.

**D. Helper SQL Functions Created:**

*   `public.is_team_member(p_team_id uuid, p_user_id uuid) RETURNS boolean`: Checks if a user is a member of a team.
*   `public.get_user_role_in_team(p_team_id uuid, p_user_id uuid) RETURNS public.team_role`: Gets a user's role in a team.
*   **NEW:** `public.get_user_id_by_email(email_text text) RETURNS uuid` (SECURITY DEFINER): Retrieves a user's ID by their email address. Used for the invite functionality.

**E. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Defined and Applied (All policies are now in a secure and functional state):**

*   **`public.teams`**:
    *   `INSERT`: "Allow authenticated users to create teams" (`WITH CHECK (owner_user_id = auth.uid())`). Ensures the creator is set as the owner.
    *   `SELECT`: "Allow members or owner to view their teams" (`USING (public.is_team_member(id, auth.uid()) OR owner_user_id = auth.uid())`).
    *   `UPDATE`: "Allow team admins to update their teams" (`USING (public.get_user_role_in_team(id, auth.uid()) = 'admin'::public.team_role) WITH CHECK (public.get_user_role_in_team(id, auth.uid()) = 'admin'::public.team_role)`).
    *   `DELETE`: "Allow team admins to delete their teams" (`USING (public.get_user_role_in_team(id, auth.uid()) = 'admin'::public.team_role)`).
*   **`public.team_members`**:
    *   `SELECT`: "View team members" (`USING (public.is_team_member(public.team_members.team_id, auth.uid()))`).
    *   `INSERT`: "Admins can add team members OR owner can add self as admin during team creation" (`WITH CHECK (((get_user_role_in_team(team_id, auth.uid()) = 'admin'::team_role) OR (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.teams t WHERE t.id = team_members.team_id AND t.owner_user_id = auth.uid()) AND team_members.user_id = auth.uid() AND team_members.role = 'admin'::team_role)))`). This resolved the team creation blocker.
    *   `UPDATE`: "Admins can update roles of other team members" (Admins can update others' roles, immutability of `team_id`, `user_id` handled by trigger).
    *   `DELETE`: "Admins can remove other team members" & "Members can leave team".
*   **`public.team_invitations`**:
    *   `INSERT`: "Admins can create team invitations".
    *   `SELECT`: "Users can view their invitations and admins their team invitations".
    *   `UPDATE`: "Invited users can update status of their pending invitations" (Invitees can accept/decline, immutability of other fields handled by trigger).
    *   `DELETE`: "Admins can delete pending invitations for their team".
*   **`public.items`**, **`public.entities`**, **`public.tags`**:
    *   `SELECT`: Allows any team member (`is_team_member`).
    *   `INSERT`: Allows team 'admin' or 'editor' (`get_user_role_in_team`).
    *   `UPDATE`: Allows team 'admin' or 'editor'.
    *   `DELETE`: Allows team 'admin' or 'editor'.

**F. Triggers Created (for RLS workarounds due to `OLD.` syntax issues):**

*   On `public.team_members` (`BEFORE UPDATE`):
    *   `enforce_team_member_immutability` using `public.prevent_team_member_immutable_fields_update()`: Prevents changes to `team_id` and `user_id` on update.
*   On `public.team_invitations` (`BEFORE UPDATE`):
    *   `enforce_invitation_immutability_by_invitee` using `public.prevent_invitation_immutable_fields_update_by_invitee()`: Prevents invitees from changing immutable fields when accepting/declining.

**G. Database Privileges (Grants):**

*   The `authenticated` role has been granted `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` (and others) on `public.teams`.
*   Similar grants likely exist or were implicitly handled for other tables based on RLS setup.

### 2. Type Generation & Configuration

*   Supabase type definitions (`src/lib/supabase.ts`) were regenerated after schema changes and login issues were resolved. This fixed type errors for RPC calls.
*   Custom types in `src/lib/types.ts` were updated:
    *   Added `team_id: string | null;` to `LinkedEntity`, `Entity`, `Tag`, `ItemEntry`.
    *   Added new types: `TeamRole` (enum), `InvitationStatus` (enum), `Team` (interface), `TeamMember` (interface), `TeamInvitation` (interface).
*   `src/app.d.ts` correctly imports `Database` from `src/lib/supabase.ts` for `SupabaseClient` typing.

### 3. Data Migration Strategy & Script

*   A SQL script was developed and executed for the single existing user (`bc2e82aa-5293-4606-940d-77d57bfd9702`):
    1.  Created a new "Personal Team".
    2.  Made the user an 'admin' of this new team in `team_members`.
    3.  Updated their existing `items`, `entities`, and `tags` by populating `team_id` to associate them with this new personal team.

### 4. Server-Side API Endpoints (SvelteKit)

*   **`src/routes/app/teams/+page.server.ts`** updated:
    *   **`load` function**: Fetches and returns a list of teams the current user is a member of (along with their role in each team). This is working correctly.
    *   **`actions.createTeam`**:
        *   Successfully creates a new team and adds the creator as an 'admin'.
        *   Returns an explicit success object `{ success: true, message: ..., teamId: ..., teamName: ..., error: null }` for consistent frontend handling.
    *   **`actions.renameTeam`**: Implemented to allow admins to rename their teams. Returns success/failure objects.
    *   **`actions.deleteTeam`**: Implemented to allow admins to delete their teams. Returns success/failure objects.
    *   **`actions.inviteUser`**: Implemented to allow admins to invite users by email.
        *   Uses the `get_user_id_by_email` RPC.
        *   Checks if the user is already a member.
        *   Adds the user to `team_members` (currently, direct add; `team_invitations` table usage to be reviewed).
        *   Returns success/failure objects.

### 5. Frontend UI (`+page.svelte`)

*   Displays the list of teams fetched by the `load` function.
*   **Create Team Form**:
    *   Calls the `createTeam` action.
    *   Handles form feedback (success/error messages) correctly due to standardized action return types.
*   **Admin Controls (per team, for admins only)**:
    *   **Rename Team**: Inline form, calls `renameTeam` action.
    *   **Invite User**: Inline form (email, role), calls `inviteUser` action.
    *   **Delete Team**: Button with confirmation dialog, calls `deleteTeam` action.
*   **Form Handling**:
    *   `use:enhance` used for all actions.
    *   `handleAdminActionSubmit` function manages common logic for admin actions (invalidate data, update UI state).
    *   `handleCreateSuccess` function for create team specific UI updates.
*   **TypeScript/Linting**:
    *   `result: ActionResult` and `update` parameters in `use:enhance` callbacks are explicitly typed.
    *   The `(form as any)?.error` type assertion is used in the template for admin action feedback to accommodate varying `ActionData` shapes while still allowing access to a potential `error` field.

## Current Status & Next Steps

*   **Core Functionality Implemented**:
    *   Team creation is fully functional and secure.
    *   Team renaming by admins is implemented.
    *   Team deletion by admins is implemented (with cascading member removal).
    *   User invitation by email (direct add to `team_members`) by admins is implemented.
*   **RLS Policies**: All relevant RLS policies are in a secure and functional state.
*   **Frontend UI**: Basic UI for all implemented team management features is in place with feedback mechanisms.
*   **TypeScript**: Major type errors have been resolved.

**Immediate Next Steps / Areas for Review & Refinement:**

1.  **Full Invitation System & Notifications (Refined from TF FR2.1-FR2.3, FR2.2):**
    *   **COMPLETED:** Modified the `inviteUser` action in `src/routes/app/teams/+page.server.ts` to create records in the `team_invitations` table (including `role`) instead of directly adding to `team_members`. Checks for existing pending invitations are also in place.
    *   **COMPLETED:** Implemented UI for users to view their pending invitations on a new dedicated page: `/app/invitations`.
        *   The page `src/routes/app/invitations/+page.svelte` displays invitations (team name, role, date) and has been refactored to Svelte 5 Runes.
        *   A navigation link to `/app/invitations` has been added to `src/routes/app/+layout.svelte`.
    *   **COMPLETED:** Created server actions and corresponding UI for users to `accept` or `decline` team invitations.
        *   `src/routes/app/invitations/+page.server.ts` handles:
            *   `load`: Fetches pending invitations for the current user.
            *   `acceptInvitation`: Adds the user to `team_members`, updates invitation status to 'accepted', and records `accepted_at`.
            *   `declineInvitation`: Updates invitation status to 'declined'.
        *   The `accepted_at` column was added to the `team_invitations` table schema and relevant TypeScript types.
        *   TypeScript errors related to `session.user.email` possibly being undefined were resolved by adding checks.
    *   Integrate UI notifications (e.g., toasts/popups as per existing Next Step) for:
        *   Receiving a new team invitation. (Pending)
        *   **COMPLETED:** Successful/failed invitation acceptance/declination. Implemented using `svelte-sonner` toast notifications in `src/routes/app/invitations/+page.svelte` triggered by an `$effect` monitoring form action results.
        *   Confirmation when an admin sends an invitation. (Pending)

2.  **Comprehensive Team & Member Management (from TF FR1.3, FR1.5.1, FR2.5, FR2.6, FR2.7, FR2.8):**
    *   **Team Settings:**
        *   Implement a check for team name uniqueness per user during team creation and renaming, so that they can't have multiple teams with the same name.
        *   Define and implement a clear strategy for handling associated data (items, entities, tags, notes) when a team is deleted (e.g., prompt user to move team data to another team or delete team and associated data). This will likely involve updating the `deleteTeam` action and RLS.
        A user can't delete a team if it is the only one that he has, so that we can't have orphaned users.
    *   **Member Management (UI and Actions):**
        *   UI for Team Admins to change the roles of existing team members.
        *   UI for Team Admins to remove members from the team.
        *   UI for non-admin members to voluntarily leave a team.
    *   **Edge Cases:**
        *   Implement logic to handle scenarios where the sole Admin/Owner attempts to leave the team or if their account is deleted (e.g., require ownership transfer or team deletion).

3.  **Active Team Context Switching (from TF FR4.1-FR4.3):**
    *   UI for users to select an "active" team context is already in the sidebar in `app-sidebar.svelte` and `team-switcher.svelte`.
    *   **Refinements to `src/lib/components/sidebar/team-switcher.svelte`**:
        *   Implemented a loading state (`isSwitching`) to provide visual feedback during the team switch API call and disable interaction with the switcher.
        *   Integrated toast notifications (using `svelte-sonner` via `Toaster` in `app/+layout.svelte`) to provide clear user feedback on the success or failure of the team switching operation.
        *   Corrected the API request payload in the `selectTeam` function to send `teamId` (camelCase) instead of `team_id` (snake_case), resolving "Invalid request body" errors from the `/app/api/team` endpoint.
        *   Ensured the `isSwitching` state is correctly reset in both success and failure scenarios of the `selectTeam` function, and that HTML elements use the `disabled` attribute (not just `aria-disabled`) to prevent UI elements from remaining incorrectly disabled after an attempted switch.
    *   Implemented state management (e.g., Svelte store, potentially persisted in `localStorage`) for the `activeTeamId`.
        *   Created `src/lib/stores/teamStore.ts` which exports a readable Svelte store named `activeTeamStore`.
        *   This store makes the `activeTeam` object (sourced from `page.data.activeTeam` via `$app/state` for Svelte 5 compatibility) reactively available to any client-side Svelte component.
        *   The implementation uses an internal `writable` store updated by an `$effect` to bridge Svelte 5's rune-based reactivity with the traditional store pattern, allowing components to subscribe (e.g., using `$activeTeamStore`).
        *   Ensure all data displays (item lists, dashboards) and data creation forms are filtered by and associated with the `activeTeamId`. (Server-side logic handles filtering; store aids UI confirmation).
        *   Provide a clear visual indicator of the currently active team in the UI. (Partially addressed by TeamSwitcher display, can be expanded).

4.  **New User Onboarding - Automatic Personal Team (from TF FR1.7):**
    *   Implement a mechanism (e.g., Supabase trigger on `auth.users` table insertion, or logic in the post-signup flow) to automatically create a "Personal Team" for every new user.
    *   The new user should be automatically set as the 'admin' of this personal team.

5.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Refinement & Testing (from TF FR2.4):**
    *   Thoroughly test and verify the permissions for `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer` roles across all team-related functionalities (not just item CRUD).
    *   Ensure UI for assigning roles during invitation (and role changes) accurately reflects these defined roles.
    *   Clarify and document specific capabilities of `Editor` and `Viewer` roles beyond basic data access (e.g., can an editor see team member list but not manage them?).

6.  **Error Handling & User Feedback (Existing Next Step - Enhanced):**
    *   Continuously review and enhance user-facing error messages for clarity and helpfulness across all new and existing team actions.
    *   Ensure all edge cases identified (e.g., inviting non-existent users, sole admin issues) are gracefully handled and communicated.

7.  **UI/UX Polish (Existing Next Step - Enhanced):**
    *   Refine the styling, layout, and overall user experience of all team management forms, lists, and controls.
    *   Consider UX improvements like disabling buttons during form submissions, loading indicators, and intuitive navigation for team settings and member management.

8.  **Comprehensive Testing (Existing Next Step - Enhanced):**
    *   Conduct thorough testing of all implemented functionalities, including all points mentioned above (invitation flow, role permissions, team context switching, new user onboarding, edge cases).
    *   Test RLS policy enforcement rigorously.

9.  **Code Cleanup & Documentation (Existing Next Step - Enhanced):**
    *   Review code for any remaining TODOs, comments, or areas for refactoring.
    *   Update internal documentation (like this progress file) and consider if any user-facing guides are needed for team features.

## Phase 2: Refactor Data Association to `team_id` (Items, Entities, Tags, Notes)

**Objective**: Transition data scoping for core application entities (`items`, `tags`, `entities`, `item_notes`) from `user_id` to `team_id`, ensuring data is correctly associated with and filtered by the active team context.

**Status**: Largely Complete.

### 1. Database Interaction Layer (`src/lib/server/db/`)

*   **`items.ts`**:
    *   All functions (e.g., `createItem`, `getItemsForUser`, `getItemById`, `updateItem`, `deleteItem`) refactored to accept `teamId` as a primary scoping parameter.
    *   `creatorUserId` and `modifierUserId` retained where appropriate for authorship tracking.
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`tags.ts`**:
    *   Functions refactored to use `teamId` for scoping.
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`entities.ts`**:
    *   Functions refactored to use `teamId` for scoping.
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`notes.ts` (targeting `item_notes` table)**:
    *   Functions refactored to use `teamId` for scoping.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

### 2. SvelteKit Server-Side Logic (`src/routes/app/...`)

*   **`app/items/+page.server.ts`**:
    *   `load` function updated to fetch items based on `activeTeam.id`.
    *   Actions (e.g., `createItem`) updated to pass `activeTeam.id` to database functions.
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`app/items/[itemId]/+page.server.ts`**:
    *   `load` function updated to fetch item details based on `activeTeam.id`.
    *   Actions (e.g., `updateItem`, `addNote`) updated to use `activeTeam.id` for scoping and pass it to database functions.
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`app/entities/+page.server.ts`**:
    *   `load` function updated to fetch entities based on `activeTeam.id`.
    *   Actions (e.g., `createEntity`) updated to pass `activeTeam.id` to database functions.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

*   **`items`, `tags`, `entities`**:
    *   Dropped old `user_id`-centric RLS policies.
    *   Existing team-based RLS policies (e.g., `is_team_member(team_id, auth.uid())`) now correctly govern access based on `team_id`.
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`item_tags` (Junction table for items and tags)**:
    *   Dropped old `user_id`-centric RLS policies.
    *   Access now governed by team membership related to linked items/tags (via policies on `items` and `tags`).
    *   **Status**: Completed.
*   **`item_notes`**:
    *   Dropped old `user_id`-centric RLS policies.
    *   Added comprehensive team-based RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` based on team membership and roles (admin/editor).
    *   Retained author-specific policies for modifications by the note creator.
    *   **Status**: Completed.

### 4. Data Migration Considerations

*   The initial migration script associated existing data with a "Personal Team" for the primary user.
*   **Note**: Application logic now consistently uses `team_id` for new data creation and queries, minimizing the risk of orphaned data.
*   **Status**: Initial migration completed. Application logic updated.

### 5. Dependencies & Current State

*   The successful operation of this phase relies on the `activeTeam` context being correctly established and passed down from `hooks.server.ts` through the layout and page server files (addressed in Phase 3 UI fixes).
*   With the database functions, server-side logic, and RLS policies updated, the backend is fully prepared for team-scoped data operations. Frontend components consuming this data must operate within the active team context.

## Phase 3: Frontend UI Integration & Fixes

### 1. Team Switcher Data Flow Fixes

**Objective**: Ensure `teams` and `activeTeam` data correctly flows from server-side load functions to the `TeamSwitcher` component to resolve the "Loading teams..." issue and display correct team information.

**Files Modified & Key Changes:**

*   **`src/hooks.server.ts` (`activeTeamHook`)**: 
    *   Confirmed to correctly load `teams` and `activeTeam` from Supabase based on user session and cookies.
    *   Sets `event.locals.teams` and `event.locals.activeTeam`.
    *   Extensive logging added and verified data population.

*   **`src/routes/app/+layout.server.ts` (`load` function)**:
    *   Confirmed to correctly receive `teams` and `activeTeam` from `event.locals`.
    *   Returns this data for use in the corresponding `+layout.svelte`.
    *   Logging added and verified data pass-through.

*   **`src/routes/app/+layout.svelte`**:
    *   Previously, this component was not passing the `teams` and `activeTeam` (received from its `load` function via the `data` prop) to the `AppSidebar` component.
    *   **Fix**: Modified to pass `data.teams` and `data.activeTeam` as props to `<AppSidebar />`.
        ```svelte
        <AppSidebar 
            collapsible="icon" 
            {user} 
            {handleLogout} 
            pages={pagesNavigation} 
            teams={data.teams} 
            activeTeam={data.activeTeam} 
        />
        ```

*   **`src/lib/components/sidebar/app-sidebar.svelte`**:
    *   Previously, this component contained hardcoded mock data for `teams` and used that when rendering `TeamSwitcher`. It did not accept or pass `activeTeam`.
    *   **Fixes**:
        *   Removed the internal mock `data` object for teams.
        *   Updated the component's props to accept `teams: Team[] | null | undefined` and `activeTeam: ActiveTeam | null | undefined`.
        *   Modified the `TeamSwitcher` instantiation to pass these received props:
            ```svelte
            <TeamSwitcher {teams} {activeTeam} />
            ```

*   **`src/lib/components/sidebar/team-switcher.svelte`**:
    *   Corrected Svelte 5 Runes syntax: removed `$effect` from imports as it's globally available. The import line is now `import { onMount } from 'svelte';`.
    *   Props (`teams`, `activeTeam`) are received using `let { teams, activeTeam } = $props();`.
    *   Client-side logging (`onMount`, `$effect`) was crucial in diagnosing that `activeTeam` was `undefined` and `teams` was showing mock data, leading to the identification of issues in parent components.

**Outcome**: With these changes, the `TeamSwitcher` component now correctly receives and displays the actual `teams` and `activeTeam` data, resolving the persistent "Loading teams..." display and showing the correct user-specific team information.
