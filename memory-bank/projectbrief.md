# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop an "Items Expiration Manager." This system will allow users to:
- Register and log in to manage their personal items.
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) items, including details such as name, description, category, and expiration date.
- Potentially manage related entities (e.g., providers/stores) and tags for better organization.
- Securely manage their data, with clear ownership of items and related information.

## Project Vision

To provide a user-friendly and reliable web application that helps users track the expiration dates of various items, reducing waste and ensuring timely use or replacement. The system should be accessible, easy to navigate, and provide a clear overview of item statuses.

## Key Stakeholders

- **End Users:** Individuals or entities needing to track item expirations.
- **Developer(s):** Responsible for building and maintaining the application.
