# Progress

## What Works

Based on the provided summaries, the following functionalities are expected to be in place:

- **User Authentication:**
  - Email/Password Signup and Login.
  - OAuth login flow (e.g., Google, GitHub).
  - Password Reset (PKCE flow).
  - Secure session management using `@supabase/ssr` with cookies.
  - Route protection (`authGuard` in `hooks.server.ts`) for `/app` routes and appropriate redirects for auth routes.
- **Supabase Client Integration:**
  - Server-side Supabase client available via `event.locals.supabase`.
  - Client-side Supabase client initialized in the root layout and available to components.
  - `safeGetSession()` helper for validated session/user retrieval on the server.
  - Reactivity to auth state changes via `onAuthStateChange` and `invalidate('supabase:auth')`.
- **Item Management (CRUD):**
  - Creating new items with name, description, category, expiration date, user_id, entity (optional), and tags (optional).
  - Reading/Listing items associated with the logged-in user, including related data like category names and tags.
  - Updating existing items.
  - Deleting items.
  - Server-side actions in `+page.server.ts` for all CUD operations, with form data handling and basic validation.
  - RLS policies (or at least action-level checks) ensuring users can only operate on their own items.
- **Entity Management (CRUD):**
  - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting user-specific entities.
  - Server-side actions and appropriate `user_id` checks.
- **Tag Management:**
  - Tags can be created and associated with items (Many-to-Many via `item_tags`).
  - Tags are user-specific.
- **Category Management:**
  - Categories are available (likely pre-defined or managed administratively) for item association.
- **Item Notes (CRUD):**
  - Users can add, view, update, and delete notes associated with their items.
  - RLS policies ensure users only manage their own notes.
- **Database Structure:**
  - Tables for `profiles`, `items`, `categories`, `tags`, `item_tags`, `entities`, `item_notes` are defined.
  - Foreign key relationships are established.
- **Frontend:**
  - Forms for auth and CRUD operations using progressive enhancement (`use:enhance`).
  - Data display in tables or lists.
  - Basic error message display from form actions.
  - Reusable form components (e.g., `ItemForm.svelte`).

## What's Left to Build

This section would typically be filled based on the project roadmap, but common next steps or areas for improvement could include:

- **Advanced Item Filtering/Sorting:** More complex ways to filter and sort the item list (e.g., by expiration range, category, tags).
- **Notifications/Reminders:** System for notifying users about upcoming expirations (e.g., email, in-app notifications).
- **User Interface/UX Enhancements:** Improved styling, user feedback, loading states, and overall polish.
- **Dashboard/Overview Page:** A summary page with key statistics or upcoming expirations.
- **More Robust Error Handling:** Comprehensive client-side and server-side error handling and reporting.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Improvements.**
- **Internationalization (i18n) / Localization (l10n).**
- **Scalability Optimizations:** If handling a large number of users/items.
- **Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline.**
- **Full RLS Policy Implementation:** Ensure RLS is comprehensively applied to all relevant tables if not already done (e.g., `items`, `tags`).

## Current Status

- **In Development:** Core authentication and CRUD functionalities for items, entities, and notes appear to be implemented. The system is functional for its primary purpose.

## Known Issues & Bugs

(Based on the summaries, no specific bugs are listed, but this section would track them.)
- Potential reliance on action-level security for some tables if RLS is not fully implemented across `items`, `tags`, etc. (as noted in `SUPABASE_CRUD_SUMMARY.md`).
- Type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as`) in frontend code for form values or Supabase data suggest areas where stronger typing could be beneficial if possible.
